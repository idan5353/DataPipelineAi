Recently, I completed another personal project in the field of DevOps as part of my journey to grow and expand my skill set.
I built a web application that enables users to upload text files directly from the browser, analyze them using AWS Comprehend, and display results in a user-friendly dashboard.

Throughout the project, I integrated several technologies and AWS services:

Next.js for the frontend

AWS Lambda and API Gateway for the backend

S3 for file storage

DynamoDB for storing analysis results

A serverless architecture with minimal infrastructure management

All deployments are managed with Terraform

The application allows:

Uploading of .txt files directly from the browser

Sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral, mixed)

Entity detection (people, organizations, locations, and more)

Clear and visual presentation of results

For me, this isn‚Äôt just another project‚Äîit‚Äôs an important step toward becoming a DevOps expert, with a focus on building and maintaining cloud-based solutions.

## üöÄ Features

- Upload `.txt` files directly from your browser
- Analyze **sentiment** (Positive, Negative, Neutral, Mixed)
- Detect **entities** (people, organizations, locations, etc.)
- Store results in **DynamoDB**
- Serverless architecture with minimal infrastructure management
- Local frontend testing with CORS enabled

## üìù Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-dashboard.git
cd sentiment-dashboard
Configure environment variables

Create a .env.local file in the root:

bash
Copy code
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://<your-api-id>.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/$default/upload
Install dependencies and run the frontend

bash
Copy code
npm install
npm run dev
Open the app
Visit http://localhost:3000 and upload a .txt file.

üìÇ Sample File for Testing
Create a file.txt with this content:

Copy code
Apple Inc. announced the launch of their new iPhone in California yesterday.
Many customers are excited and eagerly waiting in lines, hoping to get the latest model.
However, some tech critics argue that the phone is overpriced and lacks innovative features.
Microsoft released a major update to Windows, which received mixed reviews from users.
Elon Musk commented on Twitter that AI advancements are progressing faster than expected.
üé® User Interface
Entities are listed with their type (e.g., Revolution (TITLE)).

Sentiment is visualized with a chart component.

Error handling and feedback for failed uploads.

üí° Notes
Ensure the API Gateway endpoint matches .env.local.

CORS must be enabled in Lambda responses for local development.

AWS credentials must allow Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, and Comprehend access.
